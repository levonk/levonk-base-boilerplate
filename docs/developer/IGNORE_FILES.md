# Ignore File Structure and Patterns

This document explains the structure and purpose of the ignore files in this project, designed to be AI-friendly and help with maintenance and understanding of the ignore patterns.

## File Types and Their Purposes

### 1. `.ignorefile` Files
These are the primary files containing the actual ignore patterns that will be used by various tools. They follow standard `.gitignore` format and are organized by category.

### 2. `.ignorefile.md` Files
These are documentation files that describe the purpose and contents of the corresponding `.ignorefile`. They include:
- Purpose of the ignore patterns
- Source files included
- Last generated timestamp
- Any special considerations

## Autogenerated Ignore Files

The top-level ignore files are autogenerated. Do not edit these generated files directly:

- `.gitignore`
- `.npmignore`
- `.codeiumignore`
- `.cursorignore`
- `.chezmoiignore`
- `.eslintignore`
- `.terraformignore`

Instead, update the source rule files under `/.config/filelists/` and regenerate.

### Source of Truth

- Rule files: `/.config/filelists/{category}.ignorefile`
- Docs: `/.config/filelists/{category}.ignorefile.md`

Categories used by the generator:

- `vcs` — VCS-related ignores (OS, IDE, build, deps)
- `security` — sensitive/secret-related ignores
- `ai` — AI tooling ignores
- `packaging` — publish packaging ignores

### Regenerating Ignore Files

Run from repository root:

```bash
node bin/generate-ignores.js
```

Each generated file is stamped with a header similar to:

```text
# This file is autogenerated - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY
# Generated: 2025-08-27T00:00:00.000Z
# Source files: ai, vcs, security

# ===== END OF GENERATED CONTENT =====
# **DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY** - This file is autogenerated by generate-ignores.js
# To modify these patterns, edit the appropriate source files in .config/filelists/
```

### Output Mappings (from generator config)

- `.gitignore`, `.eslintignore`, `.terraformignore`, `.chezmoiignore`:
  - include: `vcs`, `security`
  - exclude: `ai`, `packaging`
- `.npmignore`:
  - include: `packaging`, `vcs`, `security`
  - exclude: `ai`
- `.codeiumignore`, `.cursorignore`:
  - include: `ai`, `vcs`, `security`
  - exclude: `packaging`

After changing any source rule files, regenerate to update all outputs.

## Core Ignore Files

### `ai.ignorefile` & `ai.ignorefile.md`
- **Purpose**: Patterns for AI-generated files and directories
- **Example**: `/generated-code/`
- **Used by**: AI tools like Codeium, Cursor, etc.

### `packaging.ignorefile` & `packaging.ignorefile.md`
- **Purpose**: Files that should be excluded from published packages but kept in version control
- **Includes**:
  - Development configurations
  - Source files (if shipping compiled code)
  - Test files
  - Documentation
- **Used by**: Package managers (npm, pip, etc.)

### `vcs.ignorefile` & `vcs.ignorefile.md`
- **Purpose**: Files that should never be committed to version control
- **Includes**:
  - OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
  - Editor/IDE files
  - Temporary files
  - Build outputs
  - Dependencies
- **Used by**: Version control systems (Git, etc.)

### `security.ignorefile` & `security.ignorefile.md`
- **Purpose**: Sensitive files that should never be committed
- **Includes**:
  - Credentials and API keys
  - Local overrides
  - Sensitive configuration files
  - Backup files with sensitive data
- **Used by**: Pre-commit hooks, security scanners

## Pattern Syntax

- `#` - Comment
- `*` - Wildcard (matches any characters)
- `?` - Matches any single character
- `[]` - Character ranges
- `!` - Negation (include pattern)
- `/` - Directory separator
- `**` - Recursive directory matching

## Best Practices for Maintenance

1. **Keep patterns specific** - Avoid overly broad patterns
2. **Use comments** - Document non-obvious patterns
3. **Organize logically** - Group related patterns together
4. **Test changes** - Verify patterns work as expected
5. **Update documentation** - Keep `.md` files in sync with pattern files

## How to Add New Patterns

1. Identify the appropriate category for your pattern
2. Add the pattern to the relevant `.ignorefile`
3. Update the corresponding `.ignorefile.md` if needed
4. Test the pattern locally
5. Commit both the pattern and documentation changes

## Common Pitfalls

- Overlapping patterns between files
- Overly broad patterns that might exclude needed files
- Forgetting to update documentation when patterns change
- Platform-specific patterns that might not work across all operating systems
