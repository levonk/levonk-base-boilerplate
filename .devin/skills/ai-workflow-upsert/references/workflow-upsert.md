# Upserting an Existing Workflow

When the target workflow wrapper already exists (i.e., `config/ai/workflows/<category>/<name>.md.tmpl` is present), switch from create mode to **update mode**. The goal is to bring the existing workflow into compliance with the workflow guidelines without blindly overwriting the author's intent.

## Decision Point — Create vs. Update

1. Check whether the target workflow file exists. Look for both:
   - `config/ai/workflows/<category>/<name>.md.tmpl` (templated workflow in skills-src)
   - `<project-root>/.agents/workflows/<name>.md` (project-local workflow, no templater)
2. If either exists → update mode (this reference). If neither exists → create mode (see SKILL.md — Mode A: Create a New Workflow from Scratch, or Mode B: Convert a Skill to a Workflow).

## Update Mode Workflow

1. **Read the existing workflow fully** — wrapper frontmatter, content template (via the `includeTemplate` call), and any `see-also` references. Understand what the workflow currently does before proposing changes.
2. **Audit against the workflow guidelines.** Check the existing workflow for compliance with:
   - **Frontmatter** (see `references/anatomy.md`): required `workflow`, `slug`, `description`, `use`, `date` block (`created`, `knowledge-basis`, `last-used`), `tags`, `see-also` relationships. Flag missing or stale fields.
   - **Description/use quality**: Does `use` state clearly when to invoke the workflow? Is `description` specific enough to distinguish from sibling workflows? Does it front-load the leading action?
   - **Step structure**: Are the phases clear (Initialize, Plan, Apply, Verify, Deliver)? Are steps in the right order? Is there unnecessary nesting or ambiguity?
   - **Template/Wrapper integrity**: Does the wrapper's `includeTemplate` call point at an existing content template? Does the content template exist and match the wrapper's expectations? Run `just validate` (or `just build current`) to verify the include resolves. **Skip this check for project-local `.md` workflows** (no templater, no `includeTemplate` call — see `references/anatomy.md` "Project-Local Workflows").
   - **Context declaration**: Is there a Context Declaration section at the bottom with file paths, external resources, and project info? Are paths indirect (not hardcoded user-specific paths)?
   - **Includes**: Does the wrapper include `base-workflow-guidance.md.tmpl` if it should inherit the shared framework?
   - **Stale or contradictory text**: References to deleted files, outdated workflows, rules that were superseded, paths that moved.
   - **`date.last-used`**: Is it stale? Update it to the current date if the workflow is being touched.

Steps 3–8 (prioritize, propose, confirm, apply, update dates, validate) and the
"never silently overwrite" and "deeper analysis" principles follow the shared
audit methodology:

---

### Audit Methodology

When updating or improving an existing AI guidance file (skill, workflow, agent,
prompt, rule, AGENTS.md), follow this process. The type-specific audit checklist
stays in each consumer's own reference file; this include covers the shared
process discipline that applies to all guidance types.

#### Step 1: Read Fully

Read the existing file completely — frontmatter, body, and any bundled resources
(`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, `evals/`). Understand what the guidance
currently does before proposing any changes. Do not skip this step even if the
file looks familiar.

#### Step 2: Audit Against Guidelines

Check the existing file for compliance with the type-specific guidelines. The
audit checklist for each type lives in the consumer's own reference file — this
step is where type-specific knowledge is applied. Flag every issue found.

#### Delegating the Audit to a Subagent

Steps 2–4 (audit, prioritize, propose) are the most context-heavy part of
the update workflow — the subagent reads the full skill, checks every
checklist item, and produces the lettered findings list. This is a strong
`[fork]` candidate per the `subagent-delegation` include. When delegating:

**Front-load to the subagent** (it starts with a fresh context — it does
NOT inherit the inlined includes the orchestrator has in its SKILL.md):

- **Goal**: "Audit the skill at `<path>` against the skill guidelines and
  return a lettered findings list. Propose only — do not apply."
- **Inputs**: exact file paths — `SKILL.md`, frontmatter, `scripts/`,
  `references/`, `assets/`, `evals/`. Don't make it search for what you
  already know.
- **The audit checklist**: copy the type-specific checklist from the
  consumer's reference file (e.g. `skill-upsert.md` Step 2 for skills,
  `workflow-upsert.md` for workflows). The subagent won't have the
  reference file in context.
- **The lettered-findings format**: tell it explicitly — "Each finding
  gets a stable uppercase letter (`A)`, `B)`, `C)`, …) + one-line title +
  before/after + tier (`Critical` / `Important` / `Nice to have`). Group
  by tier first, then letter within tier." The subagent won't have
  Step 4's format spec in context.
- **Constraints**: "Propose only. Do not modify any files. Return the
  findings list in the lettered format."
- **What to return**: the lettered findings list (same shape the
  orchestrator would present to the user per Step 4).

**The orchestrator keeps** (these are orchestrator-user interactions;
the subagent never sees the user):

- **Step 5 (Confirm)**: the ack-rule (`Go` = apply all) is an
  orchestrator-user interaction. The subagent proposes; the orchestrator
  presents to the user; the user acknowledges; the orchestrator applies.
- **Step 6 (Apply)**: the orchestrator applies approved changes (or
  delegates the apply to a second subagent with the approved subset).
- **Step 9 (Reflect & Promote)**: the reflection asks "what did *I*
  have to research/do?" — the "I" is the orchestrator, who reviewed the
  subagent's work and decided to apply it. The subagent's work is an
  *input* to the reflection, not the reflection itself. Feed the
  subagent's findings into the reflection's Q1.

**Review the subagent's work** (per `subagent-delegation` — delegation is
not abdication):

1. Verify the findings list covers every checklist item (not just the
   obvious ones).
2. Check that letters are stable and unambiguous.
3. Run the smallest check that would fail if the audit is wrong — spot
   one finding against the actual file.

#### Step 3: Prioritize

Not all issues are equally important. Group findings into three tiers:

- **Critical**: Missing required frontmatter, broken references, stale text that
  misleads, anything that breaks functionality or discovery.
- **Important**: Description quality, progressive disclosure, context
  declaration, structure issues that cause token inefficiency.
- **Nice to have**: Tag cleanup, see-also relationships, unused example files,
  minor audience separation issues.

#### Step 4: Propose — Do Not Apply Yet

Present a prioritized list of specific, actionable changes. For each change,
show the before/after so the author can see exactly what will change and why.
Do not modify the file at this stage.

**Letter every finding.** Each proposed change gets a stable uppercase letter
(`A)`, `B)`, `C)`, `D)`, …) in addition to its tier label, so the author can
cherry-pick by letter in a subsequent reply (e.g. `Go A C F` or `1A, 2C, 3B`).
Reuse the option format from `clarifying-questions.md` — letter + one-line
title + before/after + tier (`Critical` / `Important` / `Nice to have`). When
the list is long, group by tier first, then letter within tier. The letters
are the contract: a subsequent reply that references letters resolves
unambiguously to these findings.

Example findings list:

```text
Critical:
  A) Add missing `date.knowledge-basis` to frontmatter
     before: (field absent)
     after:  `knowledge-basis: "2026-07-27"`

Important:
  B) Move the 200-line script-inlining block to `scripts/foo.py`
     before: <inline code in SKILL.md body>
     after:  `scripts/foo.py` + one-line call site in SKILL.md

Nice to have:
  C) Add `see-also: skill: cli-tool-upsert` (sibling relationship)
```

#### Step 5: Confirm Before Applying

Present the proposed changes and ask whether to proceed. Let the author:
- Accept all changes
- Accept a subset (cherry-pick by letter, e.g. `Go A C F` or `1A, 2C, 3B`)
- Reject entirely

**Bare acknowledgements mean "apply all".** A reply that is just `Go`, `Run`,
`Yes`, `y`, `continue`, `resume`, `proceed`, `ok`, `do it`, or any other
bare acknowledgement with no letter references is treated as **accept all
proposed changes** — the author is approving the entire findings list, not
asking the agent to pick. Apply every finding from Step 4 in this case. Only
an explicit letter subset (`Go A C F`), an explicit rejection (`No` / `Stop`
/ `Cancel`), or a custom instruction changes that default.

Do not modify the file until the author confirms. The author may have
intentionally deviated from a guideline — propose, explain the benefit, and let
them decide.

#### Step 6: Apply as Separate Commits

Apply approved changes as separate commits, one logical change per commit
(same discipline as format conversion): frontmatter fixes, structure changes,
resource cleanup, include additions — each independently reviewable and
revertable.

#### Step 7: Update Dates

Update `date.knowledge-basis` and `date.last-used` in the frontmatter when changes are
applied. Set both to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).

#### Step 8: Validate

After applying improvements:

1. **Check for new conflicts** introduced by changes
2. **Verify all references** point to valid files/sections
3. **Test Go text/templates** render correctly (if `.tmpl` files were modified)
4. **Run `just validate`** to check for leaked delimiters and frontmatter issues
5. **Run `just build`** to confirm the build succeeds

#### Step 9: Reflect & Promote

After validation passes, run the post-task reflection pass. The full
protocol is the **Post-Task Reflection** section already inlined into
every guidance skill via `base-ai-guidance.md.tmpl` — run it now. It
asks three questions (what did I have to research/do? is any of it
generic across guidance types? does the include already exist and is
this skill written to consume it?) and produces a short **Reflection**
section appended to the audit summary. The reflection is mandatory
after every apply; if it surfaces nothing to promote, the section is a
single `Reflection: nothing to promote.` line. Do not skip the section
— its presence is the contract that the reflection ran.

This step is the post-task mirror of `research-phase.md`'s pre-task
search: research-phase asks "what already exists that I should reuse?",
Step 9 asks "what did I just do that someone else will have to redo
unless I promote it to a shared include?"

> The protocol is not re-included here. `base-ai-guidance.md.tmpl`
> already inlines `post-task-reflection.md` into every skill that
> includes it (which is every guidance skill, including every upsert
> skill that also includes this audit methodology). Re-including it
> here would duplicate the full protocol in SKILL.md for the 6 upsert
> skills that inline `audit-methodology` directly. If you are reading
> this audit methodology in a context that did NOT also include
> `base-ai-guidance`, load `references/included/...` or the published
> `post-task-reflection.md` via the three-tier resolver — but in
> practice every consumer of this include also consumes
> `base-ai-guidance`, so the protocol is already in context.

#### Never Silently Overwrite

The author may have intentionally deviated from a guideline. Propose, explain
the benefit, and let them decide. Never blindly overwrite the author's intent.

#### Deeper Analysis

For cross-file and system-wide issues (conflicts between files, duplications
across multiple guidance files, scattered context across the AI system), use
the `ai-guidance-improver` skill, which has the full cross-file analysis
framework. Type-specific upsert skills focus on single-file compliance; the
improver handles system-wide consistency.
